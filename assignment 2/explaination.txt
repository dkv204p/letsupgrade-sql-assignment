The first part of the script creates the "students" table with the specified columns. The id column is defined as the primary key with auto-increment.

The next three statements insert three rows of data into the "students" table. The INSERT INTO statement specifies the table name and the columns to insert values into.

The next statement retrieves all rows from the "students" table using the SELECT statement.

The UPDATE statement changes the name of the student with id equal to 2 to "Janet".

The DELETE statement removes the row with id equal to 3 from the "students" table.

Finally, the last SELECT statement retrieves all rows from the "students" table again to verify that the changes have been made.
